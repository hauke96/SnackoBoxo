# SnackoBoxo
A simple app for snack boxes to remember how much "deposit" you have

## What is a "snack box"?
At work we have a so called *snackbox* from [snackbox.de](http://www.snackbox.de). The idea is to have a wooden box with candy and a slot for coins.

An important aspect is, that every candy costs an specific amount of money (e.g. 80 cents) you don't have exactly in your wallet. So you put in 1 euro and therefore have 20 cents of "deposit".

Nobody can remember the exact amount of deposit after a couple of days, so this app will help to keep track.
